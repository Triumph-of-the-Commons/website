# Premise

The Triumph of the Commons (TRIUMPH) is a USA-based advocacy organization that celebrates The Commons and the vital societal functions they fulfill.
TRIUMPH aims to 
* remind people of all the incredible things the commons allow us to do,
* advocate for the expansion of the commons,
* advocate for the protection of the commons.

TRIUMPH is itself dedicated to the commons and will never be run for profit.

The main avenue for this advocacy will be creating, hosting, and publicizing articles about the commons.

# Articles

We will reach out to various experts and work with them to either write the article or help them do so. Unless/until fundraising is secured, all articles will be written on a volunteer basis.

These articles will be hosted on [Triumph of the Commons](triumphofthecommons.net) (acquired) and will focus on the commons in the United States of America.

For now, all articles will fit into the following three categories.

## Triumphs

A Triumph article celebrates the importance and impact of the commons in America.

The focus should be explicitly positive and remark on all of the ways that this piece of commons helps people and achieves things we could not without the commons.

## Future

A Future of the Commons article should focus on an opportunity to expand/improve existing commons or create whole new kinds of commons. The focus should be explicitly positive and emphasize the benefits of doing so.

## Protect

A Protect the Commons article should focus on some element of the commons that is at risk. For example, of privatization, insolvency, etc.
