# Premise

The Triumph of the Commons is an advocacy organization that celebrates The Commons and the vital societal function they fulfill. TRIUMPH opposes the privatization of public resources and aims to remind people of all the incredible things the commons allow us to do. TRIUMPH is itself dedicated to the commons and will never be run for profit.

The organization will be focused on advancing the commons in America specifically, because that specificity will make the articles more focused and target that audience more directly.

The main avenue for this advocacy will be creating, hosting, and publicizing articles about the commons.

## Motto
- The commons are vital
- The commons are efficient
- The commons must be rebuilt

# Articles

We will reach out to various experts and work with them to either write the article or help them do so. Unless/until fundraising is secured, all articles will be written on a volunteer basis.

For now, all articles will fit into the following three categories.

## Triumphs

A Triumph article celebrates the importance and impact of the commons in America.

The focus should be explicitly positive and remark on all of the ways that this piece of commons helps people and achieves things we could not without the commons.

## Protect

A Protect the Commons article should focus on some element of the commons that is at risk. For example, of privatization, insolvency, etc.
